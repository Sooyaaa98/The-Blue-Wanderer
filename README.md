📌 Purpose of This Project

This project was built to:

Strengthen understanding of game loops and rendering

Practice object-oriented design in Java

Learn project structuring and version control

Build a complete, presentable indie-style game project

🙏 Credits & Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by and partially based on learning material and tutorials by Ryisnow.
The implementation was adapted, modified, and extended as part of a personal learning project to better understand Java 2D game development, game loops, and object-oriented design.

All changes, customizations, and project structuring were done independently for educational and portfolio purposes.
